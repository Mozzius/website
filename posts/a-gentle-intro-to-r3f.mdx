Three.js is great. It's an awesome library for building 3D experiences on the web.

However, it's very object-oriented, which for me who much prefer functional programming, is a bit of a pain.

React is also great. It solves a lot of problems which stand in the way of build great user interfaces.

If only there was a way to combine the two...

Introducing... [React Three Fiber](https://github.com/pmndrs/react-three-fiber/)!

R3F takes React's powerful model and applies it to Three.js. If that sounds weird, bare with me. It turns out they mesh together _beautifully_.

First things first - let me prove it. If a picture if worth a thousand words, here's 60,000 words per second:

<SpinningCube />

Here's an exerpt of the code that renders the above (minus the mouse stuff):

```jsx
const SpinningCube = () => {
  const ref = useRef<Mesh>(null!);

  useFrame(({ clock }) => {
    ref.current.rotation.y += Math.sin(clock.getElapsedTime()) / 20;
    ref.current.rotation.x += Math.cos(clock.getElapsedTime()) / 20;
    ref.current.rotation.z += Math.sin(clock.getElapsedTime()) / 20;
  });

  return (
    <mesh ref={ref}>
      <boxBufferGeometry attach="geometry" args={[1, 1, 1]} />
      <meshStandardMaterial attach="material" color="#ff7c94" />
    </mesh>
  );
};

ReactDOM.render(
  <Canvas>
    <ambientLight />
    <pointLight position={[10, 10, 10]} />
    <SpinningCube />
  </Canvas>,
  document.getElementById("root")
);
```

If you're at all familiar with vanilla Three.js, then you'll understand how impressively consise that is.

Regardless, I bet your first reaction reading that code was "What the hell is a &#60;mesh&#62;?!".

To understand this, we need to understand how React _really_ works.

## React, Reconcilers, and what is JSX really?

At it's most basic levels, `react` is a library that maintains a tree data structure. `react-dom` is it's sister library that compares this tree (the Virtual DOM, or VDOM), to the real DOM, and updates the real DOM to match as efficiently as possible.

React DOM is what is known as a "reconciler". It reconciles the virtual DOM to the real DOM.

However, you don't have to use React DOM to use React. You know this if you're used React Native - instead of &#60;div&#62; and &#60;p&#62;, you use &#60;View&#62; and &#60;Text&#62;, and React Native reconciles VDOM to the underlying native UI system.

The clever part: who says you need to be reconciling to boring old UI trees? Why can't you reconcile the React tree to, say, Three.js' scene graph?

As it turns out, you totally can. Enter, React Three Fiber.

R3F is to Three.js as React DOM is to HTML. It's a bridge between the two. In fact, they're very loosely coupled, and you can use
